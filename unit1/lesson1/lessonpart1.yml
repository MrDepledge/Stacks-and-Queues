  Queues and stacks are fundamental data structures in computer science.&#x20;


  A queue operates on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are
  added to the back and removed from the front. Basic operations include
  enqueue, which adds an element to the back, and dequeue, which removes an
  element from the front.&#x20;


  In contrast, a stack operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where
  elements are added and removed from the top. The primary operations for a
  stack are push, which adds an element to the top, and pop, which removes the
  top element.
